Healthcare Analytics with SQL â€” Business Intelligence Case Study

Executive Summary:
This repository contains a healthcare analytics solution developed using SQL (MySQL) and Tableau. The project focuses on extracting actionable insights from patient, hospital, and insurance datasets to support business decisions in hospital management and healthcare operations.

Business Objectives
Improve patient care operations through data-driven insights
Identify revenue drivers across hospitals, doctors, and insurance providers
Track patient churn, readmission risk, and insurance coverage gaps
Support management in optimizing billing, admissions, and room utilization
